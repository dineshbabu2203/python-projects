This Streamlit app is a simple expense tracker that allows users to manage their expenses interactively. It includes four primary functionalities: adding expenses, viewing all expenses, viewing expenses by category, and calculating the total expenses. The add_expense function records an expense with details like description, category, amount, and date, which are stored in a list. The view_expenses function displays all the recorded expenses, while view_expenses_by_category filters and shows expenses based on a specific category. The total_expenses function calculates the total of all expenses. The appâ€™s sidebar provides navigation options, and users can input new expenses or explore existing data. The interface is simple, with options for input fields and buttons to trigger actions, enhancing user experience.
